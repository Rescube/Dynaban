![Dynaban: An alternative firmware for Dynamixel servos](docs/logo.png)

This repository contains an open-source alternative firmware for Dynamixel servos.

**Note 1: A bad firmware can break your servo, we are not responsible for any damage
that could be caused by these manipulations.**

**Note 2: Using an alternative firmware may void the warranty of your servo.**

## Supported servos

The currently supported servos are:

* `mx64`: MX-64 & MX-64A

## Building and programming

You'll have to install the arm cross-compilation tools. On debian-like distributions,
you can get it with:

```
    sudo aptitude install build-essential git-core dfu-util openocd python \
        python-serial binutils-arm-none-eabi gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

Then, go to the `firmware/` directory and edit the `Makefile` to set the appropriate 
`BOARD` variable, targetting your servo.

You can then run:

```
make
```

Use an USB2Dynamixel, a USB2AX or any hardware that allows communication with your servo,
and bring an appropriate external power supply. Power it off and type:

```
make install
```

This should run the flash script (see `scripts/` directory), that will wait for the servo
to boot for flashing it. Then, simply power on your servo.

## What's new ?

The hardware detection part of the firmware is complete. We can read the magnetic encoder, control the 2 half-bridges that command the motor,  read/write into the ram and the eeprom (flash actually), read the motor's current, read the temperature and read the input voltage.

The hardware abstraction layers we created (motor.*, magnetic_encoder.*, dxl*) are intended to be safe and easy to use. The control.cpp file implements a PID type of control.

A servo using our firmware will be recognized as a MX-64. You can communicate with it using the same protocol you've always used.

Here is the list of what is and is not currently implemented when you write into the MX's RAM:

     - LED : mapped.
     - D Gain : mapped (applies to the position control only).
     - I Gain : mapped (applies to the position control only).
     - P Gain : mapped (applies to the position control only).
     - Goal Position : mapped.
     - Moving Speed : mapped. Currently, setting a speed will put the motor in wheel mode.
     - Torque Limit : NOT mapped.
     - Present Position : mapped.
     - Present Speed : Needs to be enhanced though, currently has a 128 ms delay.
     - Present Load : NOT mapped.
     - Present Voltage : mapped.
     - Present Temperature : mapped. Still needs to be tested.
     - Registered : NOT mapped.
     - Moving : mapped.
     - Lock : NOT mapped.
     - Punch : NOT mapped.
     - Current : mapped but very hard to exploit because it is very noisy and the noise
       is not the same if the motor is going CW or CCW.This is the biggest issue we 
       encountered, more on that problem in the notes.
     - Torque Control Mode Enable : mapped.
     - Goal Torque : mapped but does not work that well due to the bad current measurement.
     - Goal Acceleration : NOT mapped.

No EEPROM functionality has been mapped yet. Hence, you can't set angle limitations. Will be implemented soon.

What needs to be done :

     - Enhance current processing by improving the filtering method. 
     Currently, we use clipping + first order low-pass filter.
     - Enhance current measure by synchronizing it with the PWM. The best option seems to be 
     reading the ADC when the PWM is finishing its high phase.
     - Map EEPROM functionalities. This mainly means setting up angle limitations and maybe 
     the "Resolution divider".
     - Use the I and D parts of "PID control", because real men are not afraid of them.
     - Modify how the speed is calculated. The speed ranges from 0 to 1023 (and 1024 to 2047 
     for the other direction). 1023 is 117.07rpm, 1 is 0.114rpm which is about 8 steps/s
     (the magnetic encoder has 4096 steps). Therefore, to be able to measure a speed of 
     0.114rpm, we need to wait 128ms. That's why, In the current version, the speed is 
     updated with a 128ms delay. This is very bad when you think "control loop", since delays
     create instability. The easy solution is to reduce precision (unless you're using your 
     MX to build a clock, not sure it's useful to get a precision of  0.114rpm). A better 
     solution is to reduce precision (ie reduce delay) as speed goes up.    
     - Make it possible to set a speed in joint mode (connect control loops to each other)
